# ALowPriceScrapper
Live-scraping ALDI’s site to instantly find the best value deals—saving you time, money, and effort on your grocery list.

This was fun project and useful project to familiarize myself with Selenium.
The project uses core princicpals of Object Oreinted Programming such as "Multiple Inheritence".
This project also has the capability to be easily integrated into bigger projects as this project was made with modularity in mind.
If you use the Aldi.cs as a base you could use this for other websites. (Please check their TOS before doing this)

CLI.cs is the stating file, if you'd like to just use it standalone.
